Welcome to Helicopter Guide
----------------------------

Some of our implementation ideas:

- The helicopter cockpit has been divided as left and right parts making it possible for each pilot to have their own controlling devices
- the controlling devices are realised to be interfaces that control their respective helicopter parts.
   for example: the cyclic pitch interface can change the speed and direction of the main rotor
- The collective pitch interface is used to lift the helicopter as a whole by setting the lift boolean variable present in main rotor class
- The main and the tail rotor consumes batteries when they are switched on, here the battery level usage is set to B (both batteries) as default
- As soon as the battery usage level is changed with the help of the knob present at the control panel, battery is consumed from the desired batter (B,L,R)
- The drone can be set free with the help of a switch present at the control panel
- On setting the drone free, the drone switches its camera by itself
- There are no preset storages in the camera. The sections (landscape) are stored as soon as the camera is switched on
- After human is found by the drone, the drone camera switched itself off and attached itself to the helicopter automatically
- The coordinates where the human is found are printed on the console
- The helicopter has a black box that records all activities of the helicopter. At the end of the helicopter tour, logs can be bound at src/main/java/basicComponents/flight_recorder.txt
- The two pilots can be  found in the cockpit. The paramedics, doctor and the patient are in the cabin
- the staffs are not infected. The patient lies in the Transport Unit present in the cabin.

Have a nice ride!
